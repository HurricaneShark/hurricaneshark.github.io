Virtual conferences are a wonderful thing. Figured I&amp;rsquo;d write about it here, partially because it&amp;rsquo;s relevant, and partially because I&amp;rsquo;m expecting a bean counter at my day job six months from now to order me to prove I really did &amp;ldquo;virtually attend&amp;rdquo; it.</description></item></channel></rss>
