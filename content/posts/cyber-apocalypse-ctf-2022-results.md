Attended my first CTF, "Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2022", which was put on by
HackTheBox.  The theming was a bit... odd but overall it was fun.  Contributed
the most to the crypto challenges, which was one of the categories I least
expected to be useful for, as memories of classwork from ten years ago started
flooding back in.

My team consisted of other first timers from work trying to satisfy security
certification requirements.  Our performance:

We ended up in 518th place out of 7024 teams, which put us square in the top
10% (7.4% to be precise), despite the fact we were all first timers.  Much
better than I expected.

Will do some write-ups when I get back home from Manhattan.  Unfortunately, I
didn't take screenshots and HtB has since taken down all the machines, so I'll
only be able to do write-ups for some of the challenges that I can reproduce
locally.
