Writing this from a coffee shop in the heart of Manhattan, far from home.

Hopefully this website will last longer than my last one, running a webserver
from a Raspberry Pi in your closet may be worth the geek cred as long as you
let a certain monolithic corporation manage your DNS entries automagically, but
once you've migrated to a different provider, playing Whack-A-Mole with dynamic
DNS entries isn't worth it.

Jumping on the static website bandwagon like every other nerd, don't overly care
about how few milliseconds (15 ms btw) it takes to update the website or if I win
any design awards, do care about minimizing trackers.
